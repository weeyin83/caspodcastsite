Thanks to [Writers’ HQ](https://writershq.co.uk/), our supreme writing commanders, glorious leaders and excellent but tiny overlords, who have verily granted us permission to use their splendid and sweary Privacy Policy.

##### TL;DR
We are just two people who enjoy talking. We don’t have the time or energy to do anything nefarious with your data. It’s not that We're not evil – we're as corruptible as anyone – we're just too tired to think up an evil plot to steal your identity.

##### Cookies
Seriously who actually cares? Do you even know what a cookie is or does? Well then. Yes, we use cookies because that’s kinda how the Internet works. If you don’t want our delicious home-baked chocolate chip scripts, you need to block cookies on your browser but don’t come crying to us when nothing does what it’s supposed to.

##### Stalky Visitor Tracking
Look, we’re following you, ok? We use Google Analytics primarily to stare at the real-time stats because they’re cool and to see what people are looking at so we can do more of the stuff you like. 

None of these things store any super personal data about you, but they probably nab your IP address, not that we know where to look for it or what to do with it. All we see is that a person or many people have interacted with the website in a particular way. You can mess with us by doing something unexpected on the website and skewing our stats. Or you could do something way more fun and helpful with your time, LIKE WRITING.

##### Data Storage
DATA!! It’s all about the data, baby. A tonne of petabytes whirring around the world and what? What’s it all for? WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? What will future historians actually see of us and our slowly collapsing society? So. We store your data on this website. Are you ready for this?

Honestly, we do nothing unsurprising or radical with your info.

##### Social Media
We use social media a lot. If you talk to us on one platform and we become familiar with you, we might find you on X or LinkedIN and say hello. You can ask us to be less friendly if you wish, and we will respect your boundaries.
